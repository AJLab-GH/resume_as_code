% LuxSleek-CV 1.1 LaTeX template
% Author: Andreï V. Kostyrka, University of Luxembourg
%
% 1.1: added tracking and letter-spacing for prettier lower caps, added `~` for language levels
% 1.0: initial release
%
% This template fills the gap in the available variety of templates
% by proposing something that is not a custom class, not using any
% hard-coded settings deeply hidden in style files, and provides
% a handful of custom command definitions that are as transparent as it gets.
% Developed at the University of Luxembourg.
%
% *NOTHING IS HARCODED, and never should be.*
%
% Target audience: applicants in the IT industry, or business in general
%
% The main strength of this template is, it explicitly showcases how
% to break the flow of text to achieve the most flexible right alignment
% of dates for multiple configurations.
